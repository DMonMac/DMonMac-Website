 **_DMonMac - Dianne Macaso's Webpage_**

This is a webpage displaying my profile and some projects I worked on. Here's the link to see it: [DMonMac - Dianne Macaso's Webpage](https://dmonmac.github.io)

### The Webpage
The page opens with three tabs closed. When opened, these tabs each open a main section of the webpage. To close a tab just hit the `Back` button which will appear on the lower right part of the name plate.

The three main sections of the webpage are as follows:
- [The Tech Adveturer](#the-tech-adventurer)
- [The Collection](#the-collection)
- [The Connection](#the-connection)

#### The Tech Adventurer
I probably should apologize for the fancy title, but I do consider myself one, so, why not? Anyway, this section basically introduces me to whoever visits that page.

Skills regarding coding and computer meddling are included here as well (Yes, I consider playing games a skill. That's because they help me think even when idling about.). As mentioned in the page, if you click on the icon of the skill, it should open the GitHub repository of that skill (which is just another repository you can find in this account).  

#### The Collection
Here are images of projects I worked on that are functioning pretty well. This section will be updated once I've fixed more of the projects I've been working on. Again, as mentioned in the webpage, click on the image to go to the project's respective repository.

#### The Connection
Here's where you can use the webpage to contact me. Alternatively, you can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianne-macaso-1a9974127) or the email posted in this GitHub profile.

### The Tools
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/)
- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/download/)
