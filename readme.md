## **_DMonMac - Dianne Macaso's Webpage_**

This is a webpage displaying my profile and some projects I worked on. Here's the link to see it: [DMonMac - Dianne Macaso's Webpage](https://dmonmac.github.io)

### The Webpage
The page opens with three tabs closed. When opened, these tabs each open a main section of the webpage. To close a tab just hit the `Back` button which will appear on the lower right part of the name plate.

The three main sections of the webpage are as follows:
- [The Tech Adveturer](#)
- [The Collection](#)
- [The Connection](#)

#### The Tech Adventurer
I probably should apologize for the fancy title, but I do consider myself one, so, why not? Anyway, this section basically introduces me to whoever visits that page.

Skills regarding coding and computer meddling are included here as well (Yes, I consider playing games a skill. That's because they help me think even when idling about.). As mentioned in the page, if you click on the icon of the skill, it should open the GitHub repository of that skill (which is just another repository you can find in this account).
